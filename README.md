# ECON 346, NEIU

I taught Economics 346, “Applied Economic Statistics Using R,”  at Northeastern during the Fall 2019 semester. 
It will be offered **Fall 2021, TR 5:50-6:55**.
Here is the [syllabus](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxzd2hlZ2VydHl8Z3g6MmQxZTA1ODk1ZWIxMzdjNQ), as well as a [course outline](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxzd2hlZ2VydHl8Z3g6N2I5YTRlYTg5Y2MwMGExZA) that showed the topics covered lecture by lecture.
I also made these [lecture notes](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxzd2hlZ2VydHl8Z3g6MmJlNjRjY2NhYjViNDZhMw) for the main topics. 
The suggested texts are by [Venables and Smith](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf) and [Grolemund and Wickham](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/). Some additional outside readings are included below.
